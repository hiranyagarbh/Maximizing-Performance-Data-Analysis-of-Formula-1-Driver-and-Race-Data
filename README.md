## Introduction

The Formula 1 racing championship is a highly competitive motorsport that generates vast amounts of data during races, including telemetry data from cars, performance data, driver information, and race results. This project aims to harness the power of data analysis techniques to gain deeper insights into F1 data, unlocking its full potential for improving team performance, optimizing race strategies, and enhancing overall race outcomes.


## Data Source
The data used in this project is gathered from publicly available Formula 1 dataset(s) and other reliable sources. The data encompasses both driver statistics and race information, offering comprehensive insights into the performance of drivers, teams, and vehicles over multiple seasons/years.

Primary Data Source: Kaggle Dataset


## File Structure
- README.md - this file


## Data Processing
All raw data from these sources is cleaned, transformed, and stored in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV, JSON) before performing the analysis. Missing values are handled, and specific transformations such as normalizing times and converting race distances are performed to ensure consistency.



## Data Analysis / Results
The analysis focuses on several key aspects:

- Driver performance over time: Identifying which drivers have improved or declined over the years.
- Race conditions impact: Examining how factors like weather, track type, and pit strategy influence outcomes.
- Team contributions: Evaluating the role of team strategies and car performance in driver success.

The questions explored here are :
- [x] Drivers with the most podium finishes.
- [x] Aggregated lap times by driver and track
- [ ] What factors most influence race outcomes?
- [ ] How does qualifying position correlate with race finishing position?
- [ ] What is the average pit stop time for each team, and how does it affect race performance?
- [ ] Which drivers have the most consistent lap times across different tracks?
- [ ] How do weather conditions impact race results and driver performance?
- [ ] Which tracks have the highest and lowest average finishing times across all seasons?
- [ ] What is the impact of starting grid position on the likelihood of finishing in the top 3?
- [ ] How does the performance of specific teams vary across different circuits?
- [ ] Which drivers have the most significant improvements in lap times over the course of a race?
- [ ] What is the relationship between pit stop strategies and final race positions?
